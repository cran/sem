Changes to Version 0.7-0

   o Fixed problem with analytic gradient, which caused convergence problems for some models.

   o Simplified optimization.

   o Added modification indices (preliminary version).
    
   o Some changes to start values.
    
   o Added RMSEA to fit indices. 
   
   o Added Klein dataset. 
   
Changes to Version 0.7-1

   o Replaced F with FALSE as logical, F with f as variable.
   
Changes to Version 0.7-2

   o Fixed tsls examples to run even if a global variable named F exists.
   
Changes to Version 0.7-3

   o Fixed bug in start-values routine that affected unstandardized models.
   
   o Added code to try to detect under-identified models.

Changes to Version 0.7-5

   o Made arguments to method functions consistent with generics (mostly adding ...).
   
Changes to Version 0.7-6

   o Check for negative degrees of freedom.
   
Changes to Version 0.7-7

   o Fixed bug in sem.default and startvalues that prevented the model from being fit when there are all equality constraints affect precisely the same numbers of parameters.
   
   o Fixed bug in tsls.formula that could cause the wrong variable to be identified as the response (causing the fit to fail).
   
   o Added code to detect more instances of nonconvergence.
   
   o Other small changes to code and documentation.
   
Changes to Version 0.7-8

   o Fixed bug in tsls.formula that could prevent model formula from being evaluated (producing an error).
